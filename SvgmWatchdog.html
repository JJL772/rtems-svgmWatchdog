<h1>A Watchdog Driver for Synergy  VGM Boards</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The VGM series boards by Synergy microsystems implement a watchdog timer
in hardware. The watchdog, when enabled, resets the board upon expiration.
Note that early versions of VGM boards may lack this feature. The hardware
watchdog is implemented using one of the four timers (#3) present in the
OpenPIC interrupt controller.</p>

<p>The driver described on this page initializes the watchdog timer
(compile-time configurable timeout) and starts a 'watchdog task' to
periodically 'pet' (reset) the watchdog timer. The scheduling priority for
the task is set at driver initialization and should be carefully chosen.</p>

<p>The driver also implements an RPC service for remotely watching and/or
resetting the VGM board.</p>

<p>The watchdog driver runs on vxWorks or RTEMS (a test version also runs on
various flavours of Unix), the remote client on Linux, Solaris or other
Unices.</p>

<h2>Starting the Driver</h2>

<p>The watchdog driver (along with makefiles and the host-side 'client'
program) is available in CVS ($CVSROOT/drivers/svgmWatchdog). After building
and linking the driver (either statically or as a loadable module) into the
system, the driver must be initialized/started. The generic SSRL 'system'
startup script already loads the driver but does not start it, however (to
avoid interference of the watchdog task with the user application).</p>

<p>The watchdog is started by calling</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>wdStart(watchdog_task_priority)</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>e.g. from a startup script. The watchdog may be halted (and the watchdog
task terminated) using the</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>wdStop()</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>command. (CEXP NOTE: the driver is automatically stopped when unloading by
a module finalizer. It is <em>not </em>automatically started by the module
initializer, however.)</p>

<h2>Chosing a Proper Watchdog Priority</h2>

<p>Chosing the watchdog task priority is a tradeoff. It is desirable to set
the priority as low as possible since this will catch runaway tasks. OTOH,
too low a priority may result in spurious resets if higher prioritized tasks
need the CPU for longer than the watchdog expiration (1.2seconds by default)
- cexp module loading or IOC initialization are examples for quite lengthy
operations. In any case, the watchdog priority should be lower than any
real-time critical task's. Note that the watchdog task also runs an RPC
service (described below).</p>

<p>The problem of chosing too high a priority occurs when e.g. a networking
task runs away or a deadlock occurs while the watchdog task still is
operational. In these cases, control over the remote CPU may be lost unless
'remote watching' as described in the following section is used.</p>

<h2>Using "Remote Watching"</h2>

<p>Using the watchdog driver's RPC service functionality in combination with
a host-side client program '<code>wdclnt</code>', permanent control over a
target VGM computer can be asserted. After a <em>connection</em> has been
established between <code>wdclnt</code> and the target watchdog RPC server,
the server (i.e. the watchdog driver) requires the client to send periodic
'software pet RPCs' (compile-time default: 5 seconds) and enforces a hardware
reset if these do not occur. Hence, any event leading to a loss of the RPC
connection (target crash or deadlock but also a broken network cable or a
host crash) eventually results in a target reset. Note that it is possible to
disconnect from the RPC server, thus leaving the "remote watching" mode. The
<code>wdclnt</code> program transparently connects when starting up and
disconnects upon exit. </p>

<p>While "remote watching" is very useful for development, it is probably not
desirable to use this mode during extended periods of time on production
targets.</p>

<h2>Using "Remote Reset"</h2>

<p>A VGM target can be remotely reset (using the <code>wdclnt</code> program)
either by suspending a connected <code>wdclnt</code> (for more than 5
seconds) or by letting it send a special "reset" RPC (using a command line
option) who is also recognized by the server.</p>

<h2>Using the <code>wdclnt</code> Program</h2>

<h3>NAME</h3>

<p><code><strong>wdclnt</strong></code> - SVGM watchdog client program</p>

<h3>SYNOPSIS</h3>

<p><code><strong>wdclnt</strong></code> [options] <em>target</em></p>

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>

<p><strong><code>wdclnt</code></strong> establishes a connection to the
watchdog RPC server running on the <em>target</em>. It issues periodic 'PET'
RPCs while connected. <strong><code>wdclnt</code></strong> may be terminated
by sending it a SIGINT signal which will terminate the connection. Sending
SIGUSR1 causes <strong><code>wdclnt</code></strong> to issue a RESET request
to the target.</p>

<h3>OPTIONS</h3>
<dl>
  <dt><strong>-h</strong></dt>
    <dd>print use information and exit</dd>
  <dt><strong>-v</strong></dt>
    <dd>print version information and exit</dd>
  <dt><strong>-r</strong></dt>
    <dd>send target RESET request and exit</dd>
